# 1.  Get all the different types of bike types from the "type" column.
# Use sort(unique()).  Assign this to an object btypes. Type dput(btypes)

# 2. Reorder the output of the dput command so sidepath is first.  
# Recode type as a factor using this vector of levels.  
# Print head(bike$type).  Note what you see.  Run 
# table(bike$type) afterwards and note the order

# 3. Make a column type2, which is a factor of type, with the 
# levels: 
# c( "SIDEPATH", "BIKE BOULEVARD", "BIKE LANE").  Run table(bike$type2),
# with the option useNA = "always".  Note, we do not have to 
# make type a character again before doing this

# 4. 
# a) Reassign dateInstalled into a character using as.character.  
# Run head(bike$dateInstalled).

# b) Reassign dateInstalled a factor, using the default levels.
# Run head(bike$dateInstalled).


# c) Do not reassign dateInstalled, but simply run
#  head(as.numeric(bike$dateInstalled)) 
# we are looking to see what happens when we try to go from factor to numeric

# d) Do not reassign dateInstalled, but simply run
# head(as.numeric(as.character(bike$dateInstalled)))
# this is how you get "numeric" values back if they were "incorrectly" 
# factors

# 5.  Convert type back to a character.
# Make a column type2 (replacing the old one)
# where if the type is one of these categories:
# c("CONTRAFLOW", "SHARED BUS BIKE", "SHARROW", "SIGNED ROUTE")
# call it "OTHER".  Use %in% and ifelse.  Make type2 a factor
# with the levels c( "SIDEPATH", "BIKE BOULEVARD", "BIKE LANE", "OTHER")

# 6.  Parse the following dates with the correct lubridate function:
# a) "2014/02-14"

# b) "04/22/14 03:20"

# c) "4/5/2016 03:2:22" # assume mdy
