# Read in the following infant mortality data: 
# http://johnmuschelli.com/intro_to_r/data/indicatordeadkids35.csv
mort = read_csv("http://johnmuschelli.com/intro_to_r/data/indicatordeadkids35.csv",)
colnames(mort)[1] = "country"

# 1. Compute the correlation between the 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 mortality data.
#    No need to save this in an object. Just display the result to the screen.

# 2. a. Compute the correlation between the Myanmar, China, and United States mortality data.
#       Store this correlation matrix in an object called country_cor
#    b. Extract the Myanmar-US correlation from the correlation matrix.

# 3. Is there a difference between mortality information from 1990 and 2000?
#    Run a t-test and a Wilcoxon rank sum test to assess this.
#    Hint: to extract the column of information for 1990, use mort[["1990"]]

# Read in the Kaggle cars auction dataset:
cars = read_csv("http://johnmuschelli.com/intro_to_r/data/kaggleCarAuction.csv",
                col_types = cols(VehBCost = col_double()))

# 4. Fit a linear regression model with vehicle cost (VehBCost) as the outcome and 
#    vehicle age (VehicleAge) and size (Size) as predictors as well as their interaction.
#    Save the model fit in an object called lmfit_cars and display the summary table.

# 5. Create a variable called "expensive" in the cars data that indicates if the 
#    vehicle cost is over $10,000. Use a chi-squared test to assess if there is a
#    relationship between a car being expensive and it being labeled as a "bad buy."

# 6. Fit a logistic regression model where the outcome is "bad buy" status and predictors
#    are the "expensive" status and vehicle age (VehicleAge).
#    Save the model fit in an object called `logfit_cars` and display the summary table.
# Use summary or tidy(logfit_cars, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE) 
# or tidy(logfit_cars, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = FALSE) # log odds ratios

# 7. Randomly sample 10,000 observations (rows) with replacement from the cars dataset
#    and store this new dataset in an object called cars_subsample.  Use sample_n
# Set the seed to be 1 first


# 8. Fit the same logistic regression model as in problem 6 above 
# with this sample and display the 
#    summary table using the tidy function. How do the results compare?
# Call this model logfit_cars_sub
# tidy(logfit_cars_sub, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)
